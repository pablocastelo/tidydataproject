# "Getting and Cleaning Data" Project

To generate the file [tidy.csv](tidy.csv), simply follow these steps:

1. Place the file [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) inside of an empty directory.
2. Change the working directory (line 1 in [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).
3. Run the script.
4. Wait until the a [zip file](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded.
5. The script will create a "data" directory and unzip the file.
6. The script should generate a file [tidy.csv](tidy.csv).

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
